### Cornelia feedback
- Title, Authors: Yes
- Motivation: looks good! I like the idea of changing farming practices.
- Data: FAO and IPCC. Very long time period (nice!), lots of countries (nice!). Love that you added a slide that clearly identifies the output and major inputs. I am wondering how they can attribute emissions to different categories. Could be useful to show us the data for one country in your data (I am still confused on how your data looks like, that;s why I am asking for this example). Did I miss this: no EDA on the pollution data? 
- Modeling: Week3 notebook is useful for your analysis because you work with panel data (country-year pairs). RNN is a good choice (good thinking) - may overfit to your data, but would be nice to try it!
- Experiments: MAE, MSE + others (didn;t have time to see).


### Peer feedback

#### Suggestions and/or ideas on EDA, modeling and evaluation?
- very comprehensive
- "EDA on countries and geopolitical change was interesting! I like the idea to have model at regional level!
- LSTM models would be really cool, especially with time series. I think one of the hardest parts of our modeling will be dealing with the time series nature of our data so I'm interested to see how your team does it!"
- I would have included more graphs in the EDA section. Are you doing to implement SGD directly in your code? 
- I thought the modeling was great section! I would personally have liked to have seen more EDA on the dataset so i could have gotten a better sense of what the data looks like. Otherwise I thought it was great!
- since CO2 doesn't stay in the local area, will you take into consideration regional concentrations of CO2?
- Based on the feedback from the questions, looks like adding more data to your modeling would be helpful for you guys
- They called out missing data and population features as requiring further investigation-- but is there any risk of incorrect/outlier data inputs here? How is this getting handled?
- great stuff
- Very complicated idea, but very important. All of the suggestions and questions asked during the class will be helpful. 
- I am curious if using country as a categorical variable will be useful or not, and I liked the idea of looking by region if they could find a good way to split it. I'd encourage them to take care here.
- You'll probably end up just doing the LSTM model over the recurrent neural network. depending on how far back you look to give a prediction (x-day window), LSTM will be more helpful the longer you look back.
- Wilcoxon may not be applicable to the case, based on my understanding!

#### Any improvement on communication and the verbal presentation itself?
- sounds clear
- "slides look very professional :)
- I personally like when one person goes in a chunk and gets their portion done, but that's just personal preference!"
- More graphs and visuals would help.
- Thought the presentation was great and well-communicated. It would be helpful to share the units for the summary statistic s because I'm honestly not sure what to compare that number to. 
- I think the presentation was very well organized and succinct. 
- It was pretty smooth, nice job! I think there were some audio issues but you know, tech issues happen 
- For the final project-- bringing in more visual representations of the data would be helpful to bring to light the overviews of the dataset (e.g. plots, visuals, etc.)
- great stuff
- Try to simplify the concepts by using less esoteric terms and more user friendly language to explain some of the scientific terms potentially. 
- A tiny thing, but the summary statistics were so small (with so many decimals) that they were hard to follow for me - I would have appreciated some rounding or scaling there.
- Good presentation, clear. Maybe more justification for choices of models and such


#### Any other comments?
- good luck
- i like the research question, very relevant and important! good job!
- NA
- This seems really complicated, especially joining external data to augment your analysis. Good luck!
- This is a very interesting topic! Invested on what you learn
- Very well formatted and structured, and did an amazing job synthesizing the key takeaways from the data based on the EDA!
- great stuff
- Great job with a complicated topic. 
- I appreciated the clarity of the overall presentation.
- Good work, really like the unique idea in particular. Sounds pretty complicated
